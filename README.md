# Infectious-Disease-Model

### This model simulates the spread of COVID-19 disease in a university setting. It is based on an introductory model in the curricular unit called epiDEM (Epidemiology: Understanding Disease Dynamics and Emergence through Modeling). This particular model is formulated based on a mathematical model that describes the systemic dynamics of a phenomenon that emerges when one infected person is introduced in a wholly susceptible population. This basic model, in mathematical epidemiology, is known as the Kermack-McKendrick model which assumes a closed population (no births, deaths, or travel in/out). 

### Focuses mainly on disease transmission within a university setting. 

### Model simulates avatars that attend classes in various buildings, follow different schedules each day, visit the dining hall when hungry, and dormitories when tired. 

### I incorporated the CDC’s transmission rate data to reflect real-world disease spread dynamics. With more advanced processors capable of supporting additional parameters, the model could be adapted to simulate the spread of other infectious diseases based on their respective transmission rates.
