# Infectious-Disease-Model
Covid-19 epidemic spread simulator using NetLogo
Focuses mainly on disease transmission within a university setting. 
Model simulates avatars that attend classes in various buildings, follow different schedules each day, visit the dining hall when hungry, and dormitories when tired. 
I incorporated the CDC’s transmission rate data to reflect real-world disease spread dynamics. With more advanced processors capable of supporting additional parameters, the model could be adapted to simulate the spread of other infectious diseases based on their respective transmission rates.
